# Text classification

This project builds a system for automatically classifying song lyrics comments by era. The components are:

- Basic text processing, tokenizing input and converting it into a bag-of-words representation
- A machine learning classifier based on the generative model, using Naive Bayes
- A machine learning classifier based on the discriminative model, using Perceptron
- A logistic regression classifier using PyTorch
